# Road Accident Prediction and Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to predict severity and classify accident types using machine learning techniques. The system aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to road accidents, which can help in developing preventive measures and improving road safety.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis of road accident datasets
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for accident prediction
- Classification of accident severity based on various factors
- Interactive visualization dashboard for data exploration
- Performance evaluation and comparison of different predictive models

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Flask/Django for web application (if applicable)
